css-layout
==========

This project implements a subset of CSS including flexbox and the box model using pure JavaScript. The goal is to have a small standalone library to layout elements. It doesn't rely on the DOM at all.

In order to make sure that the code is correct, it is developped using TDD where each commit adds a unit test and the associated code to make it work. All the unit tests are tested against Chrome's implementation of CSS.
