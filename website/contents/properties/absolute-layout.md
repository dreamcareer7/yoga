## Absolute/Relative Layout

### Relative Layout

The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the view, and then offset relative to itself based on the values of `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`. The offset does not affect the position of any other elements. Try out relative layout by changing the `positionType` of any child view and try to add offset to it.

### Absolute Layout

The element doesn't take part in the normal flow. It is laid out independent of its siblings. The position is determined based on the `top`, `right`, `bottom` and `left` values. Try this out in playground.


#### Position Type

<controls prop="positionType"></controls>

#### Position

<controls prop="position"></controls>
