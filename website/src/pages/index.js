        <h1>Foundation of Many Open Source&nbsp;UI Frameworks</h1>
        <p>
          There are a large number of open source UI Frameworks which rely on
          Yoga to power their layout. Yoga enables these frameworks to perform
          layout in a simple and intuitive way across all platforms. This allows
          engineers across platforms to collaborate more easily. Yoga allows
          these frameworks to calculate layouts off the main thread to help
          ensure optimal UI performance.

        <h1>Why You May Consider Yoga</h1>

        <h3>PERFORMANCE</h3>
        <p>
          Yoga was built to be fast and performance will always be one of Yoga's
          primary goals. We believe that for a layout engine to be able to power
          any range of applications it needs to be fast and never stand in the
          way of a fluid user experience.
        </p>

        <h3>CROSS PLATFORM</h3>
        <p>
          Yoga is built with cross platform in mind. To ensure Yoga can be used
          anywhere we have written is in portable C/C++ and tried to keep both
          the dependencies and final binary size impact as low as possible. This
          means you can use Yoga on iOS and Android, sharing knowledge and
          potentially code between platforms.
        </p>

        <h3>EASY TO LEARN</h3>
        <p>
          With Yoga we have focused on making it as easy as possible to pick up
          and learn. With interactive documentation pages and a fully fledged
          layout editor we believe that any engineering team can get up to speed
          in record time. If you are using Yoga with any of the major UI
          frameworks we even provide generated code from the layout editor.
